# Accelerator Processors

This directory contains instructions and code examples for running the book's code on different hardware accelerators.

## Current Implementations

### HPU (Habana Gaudi)
Instructions and code examples for running the book's code on Habana Gaudi processors can be found in the [HPU](./01_habana_processing_unit) directory.

## Additional Accelerators

This section can be expanded with implementations for other accelerator processors, including but not limited to:

- GPU (Graphics Processing Units)
- NPU (Neural Processing Units) 
- TPU (Tensor Processing Units)
- Other specialized AI accelerators

Additional accelerator implementations will help make this book's code more accessible across different hardware platforms.
